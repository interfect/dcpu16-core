# DCPU-16 Core IP in VHDL

Right now this is just an AND gate with delusions of grandure (in the form of [VUnit](https://vunit.github.io/) tests, and a [Dockerized Yosys/ISE synthesis flow](https://github.com/interfect/digilent-anvyl-example-project) for a Spartan-6 FPGA on a Digilent Anvyl dev board).

But eventually it is meant to be an implementation of the [DCPU-16 instruction set architecture](https://github.com/lucaspiller/dcpu-specifications).
